A Time Series Analysis &amp; Forecasting on Light Weight Vehicle Sales in the USA


Purpose:
The idea of forecasting the future sales on the vehicle subsector - light weight vehicles, is to understand the capability of the industrial growth, and ultimately to estimate the upcoming sales. In returns, this advantages car manufacturers to plan and budget their resource, optimize their production and inventory management, and to stimulate better decision-making processes by evaluating potential impacts of new products, and pricing strategies.

In this project, we will be going through some of the important steps that are needed to forecast our sales. That includes:
1. Exploring the features of our dataset - data quality, seasonally adjustments, and relevancy or ease to be forecasted.
2. Visual Inspections, Stationarity Check and Differencing -  identifying clear trends and seasonality patterns, checking for stationarity, needs for further differencing, and stationarity check after differencing.
3. Model Identification & Parameter Estimation - selection of time series models (ARIMA, SARIMA, GARCH, state space models) and the quality of the parameter estimated - to minimize discrepancy between observed data and predicted values by the model.
4. Model Comparison & Selection - parameter estimation (AIC, BIC, loglikelihood) on ARIMA or SARIMA models (different or mix in AR, MA components to be considered).
5. Model Diagnostic Check & Forecast - perform residual diagnostic check, generate predictive intervals and points from the fitted model.
